# C-Language
One of my favorite language in the programming world is the C-Language. C is the basic amongst all the programming languages. If you can code in C. You can code in other languages also. Mastering C is like unlock a box filled with treasure. Treasure of knowledge and wisdom. My main priority to create this repository is to give you the idea about the fundamental concepts of programming languages. I hope my hard work will definitely help you to understand the C Language.
